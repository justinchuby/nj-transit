My tools for processing NJ Transit data

## Introduction

The repository is created to solve the following issue:

When one wants to ride a bus from the Port Authority bus terminal in NY to NJ, they want to know the soonest bus (among the routes they can take) that will depart and from which gate/door in the terminal building.

This tool uses the bus data from njtransit (https://www.njtransit.com/bus_data.zip) to find all the buses departing from the Port Authority bus terminal, which is then used for the app that will display the information.
